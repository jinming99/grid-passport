# Grid Passport — Handoff

Durable record of project state, decisions, and what future work needs to know. Read this first when resuming — it's versioned with the code, so it won't drift the way out-of-repo notes do.

## Identity

- **Product + brand:** Grid Passport
- **Tagline:** Truth without disclosure
- **One-liner:** Confidential coordination workflow for large-load grid interconnection. Applicants submit private load/site/flexibility inputs; utilities and regulators see only policy-approved projections and derived proofs.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/jinming99/grid-passport (private)
- **Canonical harness:** `grid-passport-harness/` (8 specs + CLAUDE.md + 6 subagent prompts in `.claude/agents/`)
- **Vision + design choices:** `docs/vision.md` — read this to understand *why this shape*. Includes team & origins (§0), the local-first trust pivot (§5), the reliability triad and "agents propose, humans dispose" framing (§5b–§5c), and why the web demo + Tauri app coexist (§10).
- **Privacy mechanism case:** `docs/privacy-claim.md` — read this for the mechanical-evidence story.
- **Agent architecture + Claude Skills + research connection:** `docs/agents.md` — trust principles mapped to the reliability triad (§2), human-AI collaboration framing (§3), agent roster, Claude Agent Skills implementation pattern, eval framework with concrete N-targets and student-handoff task breakdown (§7), Ming Jin's research agenda on calibrating skills for workflow / human-preference / domain-spec alignment (§6).
- **Story / talk-arc narrative:** `docs/story.md` — single source of truth for both Ming's job talk and the website's `/about` page. Pre-talk it gates on the eval harness landing (§6 placeholder).
- **Master plan / roadmap:** `docs/plans/roadmap.md` — *what's shipping next, in what order, with mechanical "done" criteria*. Single source of truth for the build queue and the open decision log.
- **Team:** Ming Jin (faculty mentor, project lead — vision/design/foundation); Bhawuk Luthra (student + Dominion Energy employee — co-conceptualizer + co-developer + hackathon participant); Vikrant Bhati (co-developer + hackathon participant). Bhawuk's Dominion affiliation is the load-bearing credibility anchor for the case studies.

## The privacy claim, precisely

- `packages/policy/grid-passport.rego` is the canonical source of field visibility rules.
- `packages/core/src/policy.ts` mirrors it as the runtime (TS). Python mirror lives at `apps/api/gridpassport/policy.py`. **Drift between these three is a bug.**
- Initial page render at `/demo/[caseId]` projects for one role only (default `utility`). Role switches and counterfactuals go through `/api/scenario`, which returns only the selected role's view.
- `/api/scenario` returns `baselineFlexPercent` only when `role === "applicant"`. Every other role gets `null`. This was a real fix after a Phase 0 leak where pre-projecting all three roles shipped raw `0.68` to the browser.
- `/api/scenario` also drops the `flexPercent` override server-side when `role !== "applicant"` (Phase 3c). Defense in depth for `audit.ts` which now redacts the baseline in the override action string for non-applicants.
- Raw private values exist in browser memory only when the user is actively in the applicant role (they're authorized to see their own data).
- In the demo we simulate the confidential boundary. The release/policy layer is real; the TEE is not. Stage this honestly.
- **The full case for the claim lives in `docs/privacy-claim.md`** — mechanism, evidence layers, with/without delta, why NDAs/redacted PDFs/ZK/MPC/TEEs/DP/FL each cover only part of the surface, and what we are *not* claiming.

## Decisions already made (don't re-litigate)

- **Name:** "Grid Passport" — product and brand. WhisperGrid codename dropped after "whisper = secrecy" conflict with the policy-governed-transparency pitch.
- **Stack:** Next.js + TS + Tailwind for frontend. FastAPI for Phase 2+ Python-only work. OPA/Rego as policy canon, runtime-mirrored in TS. pnpm 10 monorepo. Vercel for hosting.
- **Phase 0 deliberately used Next.js only** (no FastAPI). FastAPI added in Phase 1c as a scaffold; swap path documented but not wired.
- **OPA runtime not wired yet.** Rego is the source, TS is the enforcement. The UI renders the Rego text + sha-256 in regulator mode so the claim is inspectable.
- **Synthetic fixtures, not real utility data.** Every number is labeled synthetic. Do not imply otherwise on stage.
- **Production architecture is local-first (Phase 3d).** Per `docs/vision.md` §5: the applicant runs the projection locally; nothing leaves their machine until they explicitly export a signed disclosure bundle. The web demo at https://grid-passport.vercel.app is a teaching artifact only. Don't confuse "the demo is hosted" with "the product is hosted."
- **TEE is not load-bearing under local-first.** It was originally Phase 4+ (real Confidential Space). Under the pivot it's optional, only relevant for utility-side delegated verification. NDAs compose *on top of* the tool — they cover residual liability; the tool reduces the surface where disclosure can fail.
- **No time pressure on the build.** Quality > speed for this project. The talk waits for real eval results; the eval harness gets built properly rather than rushed. Don't propose Plan-B-quick-ship-stubs unless explicitly asked.

## Harness bugs reconciled in code (don't re-introduce)

The original `grid-passport-harness/` docs contained three schema inconsistencies that would break a clean fixture→DB path. Fixed during Phase 0:

- Field name: `internalScheduleConfidence` (not `internal_confidence` from `04-implementation-plan.md`)
- BESS/backup units: MW (not kW from `04`)
- Workload mix: object `{training, inference}` (not scalar from `04`)

When adding new fields, consult this list first — don't copy from the harness docs blindly.

## Extending

Add a new field:
1. Add to `FieldPath` union in `packages/core/src/types.ts`.
2. Add an entry to `POLICY` in `packages/core/src/policy.ts`.
3. Mirror in `packages/policy/grid-passport.rego` field_class map.
4. Mirror in `apps/api/gridpassport/policy.py`.
5. Update fixtures (TS + Python).
6. Run `pnpm typecheck` — catches most TS-side drift.
7. Run `pnpm privacy:canary` — checks structural projection, audit-action scan, and TS↔Rego↔Python policy drift. Add the new field's value strings to `privateValueStrings`/`publicValueStrings` in `apps/web/scripts/privacy-canary.ts` if it's a new shape.

Add a new case:
1. New fixture file in `packages/core/src/fixtures/`.
2. Register in `packages/core/src/fixtures/index.ts` + `apps/api/gridpassport/fixtures.py`.
3. Synthetic SiteGeo in `packages/core/src/geo/synthetic.ts`.
4. Audit anchor timestamp in `CASE_ANCHOR` inside `packages/core/src/audit.ts`.

- Memory files in `~/.claude/projects/...` have been retired in favor of this doc. Don't resume persisting state there for this project.

## Vercel deploy

- **Live:** https://grid-passport.vercel.app (canonical) and https://grid-passport-web.vercel.app (default).
- **Project:** `ming-jins-projects/grid-passport-web`, linked to GitHub. Pushes to `main` auto-deploy to production.
- **Settings live server-side (no `vercel.json` in repo).** Root Directory = `apps/web`, framework = nextjs, install = `cd ../.. && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, build = `pnpm run build`, output = `.next`. SSO/password protection disabled (public hackathon demo).
- **Why no `vercel.json`:** an earlier root `vercel.json` doubled the output path (`apps/web/apps/web/.next`) when combined with the Root Directory setting. We tried multiple in-repo configs; project-level settings turned out to be the only stable place. Don't re-add `vercel.json` without re-deriving why it was removed.
- **`apps/web/next.config.ts` pins `turbopack.root` to the workspace root** so `vercel build` from `apps/web` cwd can resolve the Next package. Don't remove unless you stop using `vercel build` locally and Vercel's remote builder gets smarter about pnpm workspaces.
- **CLI ops** (Vercel CLI installed via Homebrew, auth in `~/Library/Application Support/com.vercel.cli/`):
  - Re-link: `vercel link --yes --project grid-passport-web`
  - Pull settings: `vercel pull --yes --environment=production`
  - Manual deploy: `vercel deploy --prod --yes`
  - Logs: `vercel logs <deployment-url> --follow`
  - Aliases: `vercel alias ls`

## Open items

**The build queue lives in `docs/plans/roadmap.md`.** Don't duplicate it here — it will drift.

Items in this section are state-of-the-codebase observations that matter to a future session but aren't roadmap-tracked work:

- **No unit/integration tests yet.** The privacy canary is mechanical evidence for the projection layer, but `forecast.ts`, `audit.ts` proper, and the route handlers have no test suite. CLAUDE.md mandates tests for any change touching projections/policy/proofs/traces — wire this before the next round of changes there. Pytest is already in `apps/api/pyproject.toml` dev deps; the TS side needs vitest or a similar pick. (Tracked in roadmap backlog.)
- **Derivation transparency — partial.** `flexibilityPassport.durationHoursMin/Max` was re-derived as coarse BESS tier bands (2026-04-18), so `bessHours` no longer leaks through that pair. Remaining surfaces with the same "monotone-invertible from a private input" risk: `flexibilityPassport.mwMin/Max`, `firmnessScore`, `expectedPeakMW`. A shared band-design pattern for the remaining derived fields is tracked in the roadmap backlog (`derivation transparency review, part 2`).

## What this doc is *not*

It is not a status page. It is a handoff — the set of facts the next person (or next session) needs to not-screw-up. Keep it short. When something lands, update it. When something's wrong, fix the code and then the doc.
